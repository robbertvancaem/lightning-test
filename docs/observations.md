# Observations

## Documentation (lightningjs.io/docs)
- Examples don't show import statements
- Examples are called 'Live demos', I would expect a link to a CodeSandbox is it's called a Live demo.
- Documentation uses the (assumed to be) outdated way of calling/importing `Lightning` as `lng` from the SDK


## Nice to haves
- When initiating a canvas and using the `precision` setting, the rendered canvas is still 100% of the original size. It would be expected that the canvas also shrinks to the size that matches the value for `precision`.
